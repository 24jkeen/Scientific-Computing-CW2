Welcome to this wonderous software!

It should be capable of solving a variety of different Partial Differential Equations

Parabolic1D.py - solves 1D Parabolic PDE's using Forward and Backward Euler and Crank Nicholson

Hyperbolic1D.py - solves 1D Hyperbolic PDE's using Explicit and Implicie Finite Difference Methods

Elliptic1D.py - solves 2D Hyperbolic PDE's using Gauss-Siedell and Successive Over Relaxation

Parabolic2D.py - solves 2D Parabolic PDE's using Forward Euler



Each slightly complicated function should have a docstring to illustrate how it is used

The code has been split into subsections by '####'s to make it clearer with a double line above the section where you actually run the code from





Required Libraries:

	Numpy
	Matplotlib
	Scipy
	TQDM - just provides some neat progress bars, change from tqdm(range()) to just range() to remove
	Math

	ffmpeg or similar writing software if you would like to save the animations in Hyperbolic.py
